postDetails: {
  paraOne: "A general home inspection is one of the most cost-effective ways to reduce risk in a real estate transaction. For buyers, it helps confirm the home’s condition beyond what’s visible during a walkthrough. For sellers, it can reduce surprises, improve negotiation leverage, and help the listing process move faster. A home may look clean and well-maintained, but hidden issues—roof leakage, electrical deficiencies, HVAC performance problems, moisture intrusion, and unsafe conditions—can exist without obvious warning signs.",
  paraTwo: "For homebuyers, skipping the inspection often means accepting unknown liabilities. Repairs can be expensive, but the bigger issue is uncertainty: you may inherit safety hazards, deferred maintenance, or conditions that require immediate attention after closing. An inspection provides documented findings and a clearer understanding of what you are purchasing so you can make informed decisions, negotiate repairs or credits when appropriate, and plan future maintenance with fewer surprises.",
  title: "Why Buyers Should Not Skip a Home Inspection",
  paraThree: "Even in competitive markets, waiving the inspection is rarely a good trade-off. A general inspection is designed to identify material defects, safety concerns, and performance issues across the home’s major systems and components—roofing, structure, electrical, plumbing, HVAC, interior, exterior, insulation, ventilation, and visible moisture-related conditions. The goal is not to “fail” a house; it is to reduce the chance of buying a problem you did not budget for. When issues are identified early, you can request repairs, seek price adjustments, or decide whether the home still makes sense for your needs and risk tolerance.",
  titleTwo: "How Sellers Benefit From a Pre-Listing Inspection",
  paraFour: "Sellers can benefit just as much as buyers. A pre-listing inspection helps you discover issues before a buyer’s inspector does—on your timeline, not theirs. This can reduce last-minute renegotiations, contract delays, and buyer anxiety. It also allows you to correct defects proactively, provide documentation of improvements, and present the home more confidently. In many cases, addressing items like minor leaks, electrical safety issues, or HVAC maintenance before listing can help a home show better and reduce friction during the inspection period.",
  paraFive: "Whether you are buying or selling, the inspection report becomes a practical roadmap. It clarifies what requires immediate attention versus what can be planned over time, and it supports better decision-making with clear photos and narrative explanations. If you are purchasing in Southwest Florida, it is especially important to evaluate moisture management, roof condition, and the home’s overall durability in a hot, humid, storm-prone environment."
